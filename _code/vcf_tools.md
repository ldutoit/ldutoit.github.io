Python library used to process VCFs during my PhD. \n Some of the main functions: <i>extract_pi_double_vcf_bed()</i> appends nucleotide diversity information line by line to a bed file. It uses two vcfs as input (one for genotypes, and one for depth at all sites). <i>count_sites_under_condition_vcf()</i> Check the number of sites that respect a condition for a sub part of a vcf file. <i>all_freq_spectrum_vcf_bed()</i> Append the folded allele frequency spectrum information line by line to a bed file filtering the vcf file according to user based conditions. It uses two vcfs as input (one for genotypes, and one for depth at all sites).
