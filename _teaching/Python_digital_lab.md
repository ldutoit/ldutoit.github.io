I taught the basics of Python to various intermediate programmers  which were unfamiliar with this particular programming language. This was done by walking through a small presentation and some working code in three hours sessions at the [Uppsala University digital lab](https://ub.uu.se/use-the-library/digital-labs-makerspace/
