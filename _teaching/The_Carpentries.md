The Carpentries is a fantastic organisation aiming at teaching the fundamental of coding and data science worldwide. They are full of good vibes and pedagogical tips and tricks. They have a fantastic catalogue of open-source lessons developped collaboratively you can use teach others or yourself. Throughout my years at the University of Otago I got the opportunity to be involved both as a helper and as a certified Carpentries instructor in workshops teaching the basics of Git, the unix command line, Python or R.
