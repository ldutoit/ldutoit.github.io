I designed this fourth-year course that was taught for the first time in the Semester 2 2020. Along with this course, I developped two tiny online applications that allow visualisation of the loss of variation as a function of population size:

### Course Outline
Course Co-ordinator: Ludovic Dutoit. Invited Lectures: Bruce Robertson and Alana Alexander

Conservation Genetics is an interdisciplinary basic and applied science that deals with
the genetic factors that influence extinction risk and the genetic management required
to minimize these risks. Conservation genomics is a multi-disciplinary science and
this course will be drawing from the field of evolutionary biology, ecology,
systematics, and population genomics. In addition of being multi-disciplinary in
essence, conservation genomics is often applied. Scientists need to be able to
communicate challenging concepts to diverse groups, often unfamiliar with genetics.
Course Objectives
On successful completion of the paper you should be able to:
  1. Explain in details key population genetics concepts such as Hardy-Weinberg
Equilibrium and genetic diversity.
  2. Be able to define evolutionary concepts key for conservation such as effective
population size, inbreeding indexes, inbreeding depression and measures of
population structure.
  3. Understand the ways in which human intervention can mitigate loss of genetic
diversity both in captive breeding and using genetic rescue.
  4. Conceptually understand the different next-generation sequencing techniques.
  5. Understand MƒÅori perspectives on conservation in general and the use of
genetics in particular.
  6. Critically assess relevant peer-reviewed conservation genomics articles
  7. Communicate effectively with people from different backgrounds
