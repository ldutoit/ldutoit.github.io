This bi-weekly event organised by Hugh Cross ran throughout 2019. It aimed at connecting people using genomics across the departments located on the Southern part of the University of Otago campus. After a topic was introduced informally for about 15mn by one of the bioinformatician, people brought their current research challenges forward or networked together for the best part of an hour.
