Welcome to my personal website! I am a Research fellow and a bioinformatician at the University of Otago in New Zealand. I am broadly interested in evolutionary genomics. I am using eDNA, transcriptomics and population genomics tools to approach research question in Ecology and Evolution. 

I also love teaching. this tiny website should help you find [resources I/we might have talked about in a workshop](https://ldutoit.github.io/teaching/) or in a class as well as share a bit of [research code](https://ldutoit.github.io/code/) I developed.
