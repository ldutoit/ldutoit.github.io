Welcome to my personal website! I am a Research fellow and a bioinformatician at the University of Otago in New Zealand. I am a range of research interests within evolutionary genomics. I am using eDNA, transcriptomics and population genomics tools to approach research question in Ecology and Evolution. I have specific interests in understanding genomic signatures of sexual conflict, the speciation process and the molecular forces shaping genomic diversity. For an overview of my research, have a look at this [word cloud](https://ldutoit.github.io/publications#word-cloud) or [my selected publications](https://ldutoit.github.io/publications#selected-publications).

I also love teaching and I am a firm believer of a **share and thrive**  research environment! This tiny website should help you find [resources I might have talked about in a workshop or in a class](https://ldutoit.github.io/teaching/) as well as some of the [research code](https://ldutoit.github.io/code/) I developed.
