This page is dedicated to available research code.For teaching material, please go to [Teaching Resources](https://ldutoit.github.io/teaching/). I tried to keep this page relatively small to increase your chance of finding something useful, but you can find other repositories at [github.com/ldutoit](https://www.github.com/ldutoit)
