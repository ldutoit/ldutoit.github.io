This page is dedicated to available research code.For teaching material, please go to [Teaching Resources](https://ldutoit.github.io/teaching/). I tried to keep this page relatively small to increase your chance of finding something useful, but my full github is available at [github.com/ldutoit](github.com/ldutoit)
